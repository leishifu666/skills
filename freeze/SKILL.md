> **Safety Advisory — not enforced on OpenAI Codex CLI:** advisory, not blocked. OpenAI Codex CLI runs no gstack safety hooks, so nothing stops a command automatically. On Claude Code this skill's hooks verify file writes are within the allowed scope boundary before applying, and check NotebookEdit operations for safety; here, do those checks yourself: always pause and verify before executing potentially destructive operations. If uncertain about a command's safety, ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.


# /freeze — Restrict Edits to a Directory

Lock file edits to a specific directory. Any Edit, Write or NotebookEdit
operation targeting a file outside the allowed path will be **blocked** (not
just warned).

```bash
[ -d "${GSTACK_ROOT:-/-}/bin" ]&&[ -d "$GSTACK_ROOT/lib" ]||{ _r=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/.agents/skills/gstack;[ -d "$_r/bin" ]||_r=${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/gstack;[ -d "$_r/bin" ]||{ echo "gstack: no install found (tried $_r). Fix: ./setup --host codex from your gstack checkout; ./setup --status shows it.">&2;exit 1;};GSTACK_ROOT=$_r;}
GSTACK_STATE_ROOT=$($GSTACK_ROOT/bin/gstack-paths --get GSTACK_STATE_ROOT); : "${GSTACK_STATE_ROOT:?gstack-paths failed; reinstall with ./setup or /gstack-upgrade}"
mkdir -p "$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT"/analytics
echo '{"skill":"freeze","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> "$GSTACK_STATE_ROOT"/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to. Use AskUserQuestion:

- Question: "Which directory should I restrict edits to? Files outside this path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) — the user types a path.

Once the user provides a directory path:

Set the user-selected boundary with the shared state writer. It resolves the physical absolute path and serializes replacement with investigation cleanup:
```bash
[ -d "${GSTACK_ROOT:-/-}/bin" ]&&[ -d "$GSTACK_ROOT/lib" ]||{ _r=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/.agents/skills/gstack;[ -d "$_r/bin" ]||_r=${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/skills/gstack;[ -d "$_r/bin" ]||{ echo "gstack: no install found (tried $_r). Fix: ./setup --host codex from your gstack checkout; ./setup --status shows it.">&2;exit 1;};GSTACK_ROOT=$_r;}
bash "$GSTACK_ROOT/freeze/bin/freeze-state.sh" set "<user-provided-path>"
```

Only report success if the helper succeeds. On `FREEZE_BUSY` or unexpected state, preserve it and ask the user to inspect recovery after any active writer finishes; never write or delete the state file directly.

Tell the user: "Edits are now restricted to `<path>/`. Any Edit, Write or
NotebookEdit outside this directory will be blocked. To change the boundary, run `/freeze`
again. To remove it, run `/unfreeze`."

## How it works

The hook reads `file_path` from the Edit/Write tool input JSON, or
`notebook_path` from a NotebookEdit (Jupyter notebook) call (shared
real-JSON extractor with /careful — one copy, sourced by both hooks), then
checks whether the path starts with the freeze directory. If not, it returns a
`hookSpecificOutput` payload with `permissionDecision: "deny"` to block the
operation (nested under `hookSpecificOutput` — Claude Code ignores a top-level
`permissionDecision`).

Polarity is fail-closed: a tool payload the hook cannot parse is DENIED, not
allowed — a boundary that fails open is not a boundary. A payload that parses
but has neither path field (a non-file tool) is allowed. A deny names the
tool, the path field, the boundary and `/unfreeze`. Symlinks are resolved
through their FINAL component, so an in-boundary symlink pointing outside the
boundary is checked against its target.

The freeze boundary persists until explicitly removed via the state file. The hook
script reads it on every Edit/Write/NotebookEdit invocation. Boundaries containing spaces
are supported.

## Notes

- The trailing `/` on the freeze directory prevents `/src` from matching `/src-old`
- Freeze applies to Edit, Write and NotebookEdit only — Read, Bash, PowerShell, Glob, Grep are unaffected
- This prevents accidental edits, not a security boundary — Bash or PowerShell commands like `sed` or `Set-Content` can still modify files outside the boundary
- To deactivate, run `/unfreeze`; ending or killing a conversation does not remove persisted state
