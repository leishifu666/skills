"""This suite must not shrink silently.

A module that fails to import is replaced by one synthetic `_FailedTest`, so N real tests become 1
error and the count drops with nothing naming what went missing. It happened here: an indentation
error left three tests uncollected, and the only reason it surfaced was counting `def test_` against
what actually ran.

Discovery runs in a subprocess deliberately. Discovering a suite from inside itself is order- and
path-dependent -- importing a test module runs its module-level `sys.path.insert`, so a second
in-process discover resolves against a path the first did not have.
